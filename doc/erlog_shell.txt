MODULE SUMMARY

        Erlog shell

DESCRIPTION

        Erlog is a Prolog interpreter implemented in Erlang and
        integrated with the Erlang runtime system. This is a simple
        prolog like shell to run Erlog.

        The database is initialised by calling DbModule(DbInitArg). If
        DbModule and DbInitArg are not given then the default database
        will be used.

EXPORTS

start() -> ShellPid.
start(DbModule, DbInitArg) -> ShellPid.

        Start a simple Erlog shell in a new process. Goals can be
        entered at the "?-" prompt. When the goal succeeds the
        variables and their values will be printed and the user
        prompted. If a line containing a ";" is entered the system
        will attempt to find the next solution, otherwise the system
        will return to the "?-" prompt.

server() -> ok.
server(DbModule, DbInitArg) -> ok.

        Start a simple Erlog shell in the current process.
